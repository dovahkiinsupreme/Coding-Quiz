# Coding-Quiz

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a coding quiz.

I learned how to: 
<ul>
    <li>Create functions to handle click events</li>
    <li>create a timer</li>
    <li>show/hide items using getelementbyid </li>
    <li>I was unable to get the function that stores scores and user input initials to work</li> 
</ul>

## Usage

Upon arriving at the webpage, there is a start button to begin a coding quiz. Selecting a correct answer makes the window background color appear green, indicating a correct response, at which point the user would select "next" to move to the next question. If an incorrect response is selected, the window background changes to red indicating an incorrect response. The questions are generated in a random order.

If the timer expires before quiz completion, an alert appears to let the user know they are out of time.

On the last page of the quiz, there is a button to restart the quiz.
